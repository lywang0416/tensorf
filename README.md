# TensoRF
Just a copy from https://github.com/apchenstu/TensoRF.git and train on my own data. 
## Installation

#### Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 + Pytorch 1.10.1 

Install environment:
```
conda create -n TensoRF python=3.8
conda activate TensoRF
pip install torch torchvision
pip install tqdm scikit-image opencv-python configargparse lpips imageio-ffmpeg kornia lpips tensorboard
```


## Quick Start
The training script is in `train.py`, to train a TensoRF:

```
python train.py --config configs/lego.txt
```


we provide a few examples in the configuration folder, please note:

 `dataset_name`, choices = ['blender', 'llff', 'nsvf', 'tankstemple'];

 `shadingMode`, choices = ['MLP_Fea', 'SH'];

 `model_name`, choices = ['TensorVMSplit', 'TensorCP'], corresponding to the VM and CP decomposition. 
 You need to uncomment the last a few rows of the configuration file if you want to training with the TensorCP modelï¼›

 `n_lamb_sigma` and `n_lamb_sh` are string type refer to the basis number of density and appearance along XYZ
dimension;

 `N_voxel_init` and `N_voxel_final` control the resolution of matrix and vector;

 `N_vis` and `vis_every` control the visualization during training;

  You need to set `--render_test 1`/`--render_path 1` if you want to render testing views or path after training. 

More options refer to the `opt.py`. 

### For pretrained checkpoints and results please see:

## Rendering

```
python train.py --config configs/lego.txt --ckpt path/to/your/checkpoint --render_only 1 --render_test 1 
```

You can just simply pass `--render_only 1` and `--ckpt path/to/your/checkpoint` to render images from a pre-trained
checkpoint. You may also need to specify what you want to render, like `--render_test 1`, `--render_train 1` or `--render_path 1`.
The rendering results are located in your checkpoint folder. 

## Extracting mesh
You can also export the mesh by passing `--export_mesh 1`:
```
python train.py --config configs/lego.txt --ckpt path/to/your/checkpoint --export_mesh 1
```
Note: Please re-train the model and don't use the pretrained checkpoints provided by us for mesh extraction, 
because some render parameters has changed.
